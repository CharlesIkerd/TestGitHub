Basic Git functions to remember
===============================
	git clone
	==========
	->>> Clones a repository to your computer
	->>> Example: git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

	After run git clone does the following...
		-creates a new folder called repo, which is initialized as a Git repository
		-Creates a remote called origin which points to the url you cloned from
		-All of the repos files and commits are downloaded there
		-default branch(master) is then checked out

	git fetch
	=========
	->>> Retrieves new work done by other people, without merging with your own work
	->>> if you have a local repo with a remote URL, you can grab all new information with the function git fetch remotename, if not then you can add a new remote and fetch there.


	git merge
	=========
	->>> Combines local changes with the changes made by others
	->>> Used to merge remote-trackiong branch with your local branch
	->>> Example use: git merge remotename/branchname

	git pull
	========
	->>> Function that combines the uses of fetch and merge
	->>> Example: git pull remotename branchname
	*tips*
	-make sure you commit all of your local work bufore running the pull command
	- helps protect against merge conflicts that you cannot resolve, you would have to git merge --abort to take the branch back to where you didn't pull.
